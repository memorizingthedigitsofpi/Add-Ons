/* CHANGE THE BACKGROUND COLOUR OF EVEN-NUMBERED COMMENTS

AO3 puts a slight shading on every-other comment in a thread.
This can sometimes look like reader comments have one background and author comments have a different background, but it's based on position in the list, not on who is leaving the comment. 

In this code, you can change just the border colour or just the background colour or both. 
If you only want to change one, delete the other one from the code. You can use a tool like a hex colour picker to help you find a shade that you like.
