/* This section of code changes the colour of the Warning tags to red. 
It also removes the bold.  
You can set any colour you like by changing the hex code. 
The hex code here is #cc0a31. 

Make sure you include a # at the start of the hex code. 
Make sure you have a ; at the end of the line. 
If you want to keep the Warnings bolded, remove the line   font-style: normal;

It also changes the tag colour to purple. 
If you want to keep a background colour behind the tags but you want to choose your own colour, you can replace the word none with a hex code.  
If you want the relationships to be bolded, you can add in the line      font-style: bold;  
If you want them to be italicized, you can add the line      font-style: italic;
