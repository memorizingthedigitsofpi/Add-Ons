/* CHANGE THE BACKGROUND COLOUR OF A TAG BASED ON THE TEXT OF THE TAG

Use this code to either "black out" or highlight tags to make them easier to see or avoid. 
This code doesn't look at the meaning of a tag and it doesn't connect to synonyms. 
It is based entirely on the text string that you enter. 

Be aware, if you are copy/pasting this code on a mobile device, your device may change the quotation marks. 
The quotes should look straight up and down. 
If they have a slight curl to them, the code will not work. 
If your code isn't working, try deleting the quotes and replacing them. 

Change the text inside of the quotation marks to whatever tag you want to highlight or black out. 

You can set the background to one colour and the text to another colour that's easy to read on that background. 
You can use a tool like a hex colour picker to help you find shades that you like.
