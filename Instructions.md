CREATING A NEW SITE SKIN

In order to create a site skin, you need to have an AO3 account and you need to be logged in. 

1. At the top of the page, tap on your username.
2. From the dropdown menu that appears, tap on Dashboard.
3. On your Dashboard, tap on the link called Skins.
4. On the Skins page, tap on the button labelled Create Site Skin.
5. Give your site skin a unique title. I usually add my username or nickname to the end of my title in order to make it unique. You need a unique title in order to save your skin.
6. Copy the code you like and paste it into the CSS box. 
7. After you have pasted all of the bits of code that you want to include, scroll to the bottom of the page and tap on the button labelled Submit. This will save your site skin and take you to a new page where you can see the title of your skin as well as all of the code.
8. On the site skin page, tap on the button labelled Use. You will now have this skin every time you're logged in on any device. 


MODIFYING AN EXISTING SKIN

You can use this code with any skin other skin by making use of Parent Skins. This is a feature that AO3 has that allows you to easily combine skins together. 

1. Follow the steps above to create your new site skin. You can either pause after step 6 above and follow these instructions or you can save your new skin by hitting submit and then Update it with the following. 
2. At the bottom of the CSS box, look for the word Advanced and tap on the button labelled Show.
3. Tap on the button labelled Add Parent Skin.
4. Start typing the name of the skin you want to combine your new code with. This can be any of the public site skins (like Reversi, for example) or any custom skin that you have made yourself.
5. Choose the name from the dropdown menu.
6. Either follow steps 7 and 8 from above (if you paused at step 6) or press the Update button to save your additions.
