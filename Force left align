/* FORCE TEXT IN FICS TO ALIGN TO THE LEFT HAND SIDE

This will force all text inside a fic to start on the left hand side of your screen. 
Nothing will be centered or right-aligned (unless the author uses the space bar or tab key to set their spacing)

You can modify this code to set everything to center or to right if you'd prefer. Just change the word 'left' in the code.
