/*Change the font size for fics. 

This code will change the size of the font inside a work on AO3 but leave the rest of the site as is. 
If you want to change the font size for the entire site, you will need different code. 

The number in this code is the percentage of the usual font size for the page. 
You can adjust that number to whatever font size is comfortable to you. 

Numbers larger than 100% will be bigger than the standard size.
Numbers smaller than 100% will be smaller.
